## Innate immune system
- Macrophages: degrade pathogens and dead body cells via *phagocytosis*
- Dendritic cells: Identify foreign pathogens, present antigen to activate other immune cells
- Natural killer cells: Release toxins to destroy virus-infected body cells
- Basophils: Sound the alarm, release mediators like histamine which stimulates inflammatory response
- Neutrophils: kill bacteria
- Eosinophils - fight parasites
