### Sn1 Reactions
- Unimolecular nucleophilic substitution
- Step 1: LG leaves, forming carbocation
- Step 2: nucleophile attacks from either side, forming a *racemic mixture of products*

### Sn2 Reactions
- Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution
- Only 1 step
- Nucleophile performs backside attack and LG leaves simultaneously
- Stereochemistry is inverted
- Prefers less-susbstituted carbons bc of steric hindrance
