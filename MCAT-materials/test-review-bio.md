# Review of MCAT Free Full-Length Sample Test

## Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems

### Missed Questions

**Question 4**
Subcategory: Cellular biology

Key concept: Proteins, once created, usually follow these steps: 

#### Cytoplasm -> endoplasmic reticulum -> Golgi apparatus -> cell membrane

Retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER occurs when proteins that cycle between the ER and Golgi must be retrieved.

**Question 8**
Subcategory: Organs and organ systems

Key concept: When given the choice between different treatments, choose the one that will prevent the symptom from occurring, rather than attacking the results of the symptom.

>Example: Which is preferred treatment for opioid addiction, Narcan or naltrexone?
>
>Answer: Naltrexone would be preferred because it prevents the harmful symptom (overdose) from occurring.

**Question 9**
Subcategory: Organs and organ systems

Key concept: Repeated use of xeno-antibodies, such as mouse antibodies, in the same patient will elicit the production of human anti-mouse antibodies over time.

For more details on this, look up the [HAMA response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anti-mouse_antibody)

**Question 13**
Subcategory: Central dogma

Key concept: 

#### Stages of transcription

1. [Initiation](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/22a15818999b09a1ba58a9abaadfe1045c93d2f4.png) -
- RNA polymerase binds to the promoter sequence at the beginning of the gene.
Then, the enzyme unzips the DNA strands.

2. [Elongation](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/1da89713b9aa8067742244d916749e72561bb3cc.png) - 
The *template strand* of DNA acts as a template while RNA plymerase builds a strand of complementary nucleotides.
The mRNA strand grows from 5' to 3'. 

The RNA strand carries the same information as the non-template strand of DNA, but it contains uracil (U) instead of thymine (T).

3. Termination - A terminator sequence signals that the RNA strand is complete. Once transcribed, they cause release of the transcript.

4. [Modification](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/63dbd2d4d2bbdba7861bd7d904113e4364adf71b.png) - 
In eukaryotic organisms, the transcript is only *pre-mRNA*. It must be modified before translation.

 - The mRNA must add a 5' cap at the beginning and a 3' poly-A tail at the end.
 This increases the stability of the mRNA.
 - It will often undergo splicing, where introns are cut out, leaving the exons stuck together.
 If introns are not removed, the resulting polypeptide will be faulty.
		

**Question 15**
Subcategory: Acid/base reactions

Key concept: The pH of blood is higher than that of pure water, usually around 7.4. This is maintained by other equilibria (buffers).
