## Neuronal activation
1. Resting membrane potential is -70mV, maintained by channels that pump out Na+ and bring in K+
2. Stimulus causes Na+ channels to open and depolarization, meaning potential becomes more positive. Leads to *Action Potential* (AP) at a certain threshold
3. Once AP reaches peak, Na+ channels close and voltage-gated K+ channels open
4. K+ rushes out of the neuron resulting in *repolarization*
