# Review of MCAT Free Full-Length Sample Test

## Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems

### Missed Questions

**Question 2** 
Subcategory: Molecular configurations
Key concept: The number of stereoisomers for a compound with *n* chiral centers is equal to 2^n possible stereoisomers.

**Question 3**
Subcategory: Bioenergetics
Key concept: A precipitation reaction occurs when dissolved substances react to form a solid product. The solid will form when the reaction quotient, Q, exceeds the equilibrium constant Ksp. 
	Q= Product of concentrations of reactants

**Question 5**
Subcategory: Electricity and magnetism
Key concept: Electric fields *by definition* start on a positive charge. They point towards negative charges.

In the body, axons rest at a negative potential, while the surrounding fluid is neutral. 


**Question 20**
Subcategory: Bioenergetics
Key concept: The Michaelis-Menten equation governs reaction velocity in enzymatic reactions.
V0 = (Vmax x S) / (Km + S)
V0 = reaction velocity, Vmax = maximum reaction velocity, S = substrate concentration, Km = Michaelis constant

The [Lineweaver Burk](https://www.medschoolcoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-1-Lineweaver-Burk-plot-.webp)  plot is a way to represent a Michaelis-Menten governed reaction. 
In the Lineweaver Burk plot, the x-axis is 1/S, and y-axis is 1/V0. The slope is thus S/V0, and the y-intercept is Vm.
