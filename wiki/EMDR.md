EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is a relatively new type of therapy for PTSD. It seems to be decently well-established in the therapy community, and is recognized to be effective by the American Psychiatric Assocation (source:<[https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments/eye-movement-reprocessing>]

Rather than talking or medication, the patient (usually a PTSD patient) will be asked to recall their traumatic experience, their reaction to it, and how it made them feel about themselves. Meanwhile, they're asked to do repetitive "bilateral stimulation," usually meaning eye movements.

The idea is that it allows patients to access the memory of the traumatic event, rather than blocking it off. By forming new associations with the event, the patient allows their brain to heal the damage, like a wound is healed once you remove occlusion.

I'd like to learn more about this.
