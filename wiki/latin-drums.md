### Songo
Made for drumset, this one has a bomba kick drum. Lots of room for variation

# Intermediate
Mozambique - quarter notes on both feet.

Right hand playing a modified cascara, but the left hand gives this one its feel... basic version will be *dotted quarter-notes* alternating between voices on the set.
